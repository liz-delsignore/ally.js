# Supports - Browser compatibility

The supports infrastructure is a set of tests determining browser behavior and compatibility at runtime. This piece of the infrastructure does for focus management what [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/) does for the rest of the web platform.

The tests change focus to detect compatibility and thereby cause focus change announcements in screen readers, as well as [force the browser to perform layout / reflow operations](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a#what-forces-layout--reflow), commonly known as [layout thrashing](http://kellegous.com/j/2013/01/26/layout-performance/). To limit these effects, tests are performed in an iframe and cached in [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), so only the first impression of a document on a given domain will have to live with the overhead.

For the tests to run properly, the document needs to have focus during execution. If it does not, e.g. because the browser's DevTools have focus, the cache is invalidated.

## Changes

* As of `v#master` *all* tests are run at once and within an iframe to limit layout thrashing.


## Contributing

Tests go in `src/supports` and results are used through the `src/supports/supports.js` module.
