  <h1>Dialog Tutorial</h1>

  <p>View the source of this page to see how a visually appealing, yet fully accessible dialog can be created. The rules for accessible dialogs are laid out in <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/#dialog_modal">WAI-ARIA 1.0 Authoring Practices</a></p>
  <p>There are two input fields surrounding the "open dialog" button to mimic interactive content outside of the dialog. They have no other purpose than serve as proof of focus being trapped within the dialog once it's shown.</p>
</article>

<div id="example-html">
  <main>
    <div>
      <label for="before-button">Demo Text Input before Dialog Button</label> <input id="before-button">
    </div>
    <section>
      <button type="button" id="open-dialog">Show Dialog</button>
    </section>

    <label for="after-button">Demo Text Input after Dialog Button</label> <input id="after-button">
  </main>

  <!--
    If not using the <dialog> element of HTML5.1, it's best to use the <div> element for widgets
    with semantic meaning that can only be defined via aria.

    It is not uncommon to wrap the dialog's content in a <form>,
    provide the confirmation button <button type="submit">OK</button>,
    and wire up the submit event to close the dialog after processing
    the user's input (while preventing the form submission itself).

    This has the added benefit of <kbd>Enter</kbd> working out of the
    box, without JavaScript having to listen for the key to be pressed.
    Also touchscreen devices (such as modern mobile phones) have
    built-in heuristics that change the appearance of OnScreenKeyboards
    depending on <form> and <input> type.

    When dealing with elements that contain focus, it is a good idea to make them focusable themselves
    by adding tabindex="-1". This way a mouse click in the background of the dialog won't pass focus
    to the document, but retain it in the dialog.

    The aria attributes role, aria-labeledby and aria-describedby are necessary for the Accessibility Tree
    to properly expose our dialog widget. Their specific meaning is explained here:

    * http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#dialog
    * http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-labelledby
    * http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-describedby
  -->
  <div id="dialog" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="dialog-title" aria-describedby="dialog-description" tabindex="-1" hidden>
    <form class="dialog-content">
      <header>
        <!--
          The dialog's header explains what the user is being interrupted for.
          While a label is considered mandatory, an extended description is optional.
        -->
        <h1 id="dialog-title">Name Entry</h1>
        <p id="dialog-description">Please enter your full name.</p>
      </header>
      <section>
        <!--
          A dialog can do anything from displaying simple text, to hosting
          complex user interaction. But since the latter is generally
          considered bad practice, try keeping your dialogs as simple
          as possible.
        -->
        <label for="within-dialog">Name</label> <input id="within-dialog">
      </section>
      <footer>
        <!--
          the footer of a dialog usually contains its control buttons
          to close, confirm or do something else entirely.
        -->
        <button type="button" id="close-dialog">Close</button>
        <button type="submit" id="save-dialog">Save</button>
